# FriendlyId

FriendlyId is the "Swiss Army bulldozer" of slugging and permalink plugins for
Ruby on Rails. It allows you to create pretty URL's and work with
human-friendly strings as if they were numeric ids for Active Record models.

Using FriendlyId, it's easy to make your application use URL's like:

    http://example.com/states/washington

instead of:

    http://example.com/states/4323454

## FriendlyId Features

FriendlyId offers many advanced features, including: slug history and
versioning, scoped slugs, reserved words, custom slug generators, and
excellent Unicode support. For complete information on using FriendlyId,
please see the [FriendlyId Guide](http://norman.github.com/friendly_id/file.Guide.html).

FriendlyId is compatible with Active Record **3.0** and **3.1**.
