require "friendly_id/slug"

module FriendlyId

=begin
This module adds the ability to store a log of a model's slugs, so that when its
friendly id changes, it's still possible to perform finds by the old id.

The primary use case for this is avoiding broken URLs.

== Setup

In order to use this module, you must add a table to your database schema to
store the slug records. FriendlyId provides a generator for this purpose:

  rails generate friendly_id
  rake db:migrate

This will add a table named +friendly_id_slugs+, used by the {FriendlyId::Slug}
model.

== Considerations

This module is incompatible with the +:scoped+ module.

Because recording slug history requires creating additional database records,
this module has an impact on the performance of the associated model's +create+
method.

== Example

    class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
      extend FriendlyId
      friendly_id :title, :use => :history
    end

    class PostsController < ApplicationController

      before_filter :find_post

      ...

      def find_post
        return unless params[:id]
        @post = begin
          Post.find params[:id]
        rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
          Post.find_by_friendly_id params[:id]
        end
        # If an old id or a numeric id was used to find the record, then
        # the request path will not match the post_path, and we should do
        # a 301 redirect that uses the current friendly id.
        if request.path != post_path(@post)
          return redirect_to @post, :status => :moved_permanently
        end
      end
    end
