## FAQ

Here are the answers to some common questions.

### How do I set up my routes for FriendlyId?

Exactly like in any other Rails app. FriendlyId doesn't change any routing
functionality, it only changes the ids that are shown in your routes.

TIP: Make your app work the way you want to with numeric id's. Then add
FriendlyId later.

### I'm seeing `undefined method `friendly_id'`

You probably just added the friendly_id gem. Run `bundle` and restart your
Rails app.

### I'm seeing `uninitialized constant FriendlyId`

You probably just added the friendly_id gem. Run `bundle` and restart your
Rails app.
